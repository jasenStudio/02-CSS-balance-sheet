# Practice: Pseudo Selectors in CSS

Welcome to the practice session on pseudo selectors in CSS! This repository contains examples and exercises to help you learn and improve your web design skills using pseudo selectors.

## ðŸ“š What are pseudo selectors?

Pseudo selectors in CSS are keywords added to selectors to specify a special state of the selected element or apply styles to specific parts of the DOM.

### Common examples
- `:hover`: Applies styles when the user hovers the cursor over an element.
- `:focus`: Applies styles when an element, such as an input field, is focused.
- `:nth-child()`: Selects a specific child of a parent element.
- `::before` and `::after`: Inserts content before or after an element.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

â”œâ”€â”€ index.html â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
